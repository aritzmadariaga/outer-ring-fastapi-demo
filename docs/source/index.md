# Outer Ring Technical Documentation

Welcome to the technical documentation for the Outer Ring FastAPI project.

This documentation is auto-generated from the source code and Markdown files.

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern, separating concerns into the following layers:

- **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer**: Contains the core business logic.
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data access and persistence.
- **Schema Layer**: Defines data validation and serialization models.
- **Core Layer**: Includes configuration, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns.
